<h2>CAREER</h2>
<p class="style">In June 2012, Shroff was signed by producer Sajid Nadiadwala to make his film debut with Sabbir Khan's action romantic comedy Heropanti, which was produced under Nadiadwala's banner Nadiadwala Grandson Entertainment.[30][31] In preparation for the role, he underwent flexibility training under Ziley Mawai.[10] Released in 2014, Heropanti garnered unfavourable reactions from critics but emerged as a commercial success with earnings of ₹726 million (US$10 million) worldwide.[32][33] For his performance, Shroff received mainly mixed to positive reviews, with critics primarily praising dancing skills and ability to perform onerous stunts.[34][35] Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama appreciated his performance, saying "Tiger registers an impact in several sequences" and that he "scores brownie points in action and stunts". Adarsh also added that "for a first-timer, he exudes supreme confidence",[36] whereas Subhash K.
